### Hello! 🐱‍💻

Nice to meet you. I am Biel, a junior developer from Barcelona, Spain.
Welcome to my Github page!
よろしくおねがいします。

I still have a long way to go, but I'm trying to take each step carefully and get everything I can out of them. ☺
I strive to be able to work as a game developer in Japan at some point! 👾

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a small game in GameMaker
- 🌱 I’m currently learning best practices for web app development and Nginx 
- 📚 I’m currently reading Clean Architecture, by Robert C. Martin
- 📫 How to reach me: bielsesa@gmail.com, I promise I look my email everyday! Or at least almost everyday...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm allergic to cats, but I currently live with two... 🐱‍🐉🐱‍🚀
- 🌐 You can speak with me in English, Spanish, Catalan and I hope a bit of Japanese soon 😃
